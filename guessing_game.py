Extra Credit

4 steps
    2.  As a player of the game, after I guess correctly I should be prompted if I would like to play again.
    3.  As a player of the game, at the start of each game I should be shown the current high score (least amount of points) so that I know what I am supposed to beat.
    4.  Every time a player decides to play again, the random number to guess is updated so players are guessing something new each time.
